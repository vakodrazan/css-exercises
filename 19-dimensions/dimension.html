      <h1>Dimensions</h1>
      <p>
        In this we are looking for the dimensions like width and height.
      </p>
    </header>
    <main>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Dimensions' default values.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Every property has their own default value.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
             min-width has <q>0</q> as its default value.
          </li>
          <li>
            The default value of max-width is <q>none</q>.
          </li>
          <li>
            min-height's default value is <q>0</q>.
          </li>
          <li>
             max-height has a default value <q>none</q>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          The affect when make a change
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In my thinking, it affects the width and height when we use a block or an inline element.
          </li>
          <li>
            It doesn't affect anything even though we set min-width value greater than a width value. It will take the value of the min-width.
          </li>
          <li>
            It always takes the value of the max-width because we specified it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because we set the max-width and it always take the value of max-width even though we specified a value of min-width.
          </li>
          <li>
            When we applied a width in a table cells but then it doesn't fit in the content, the words will just wrap in a new line.
          </li>
          <li>
            When we set percentage as the value of height property, it makes it more complex and difficult to use a percentage value. We don't even know percent of what is it. In my understanding, the percentage we set with height is the percentage  of the device.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <footer>
        <h2>
          Rulset
        </h2>
        <p>
          The significant or interesting characteristics rulset with this examples is we use the vw(Viwport width) because one it has a relation with the percentage <q>1vw=1%</q>.
        </p>
        As I said before if we set a max-width it always sets the value of the character even if we set the min-width value whether its value is greater or less than max-width.
