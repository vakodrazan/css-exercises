        <h2>Keyframe Animation</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Keyframe Animation setup needs some unique code, that starts with the initial state.
          </li>
          <li>
            What makes the keyframes code different to the rest of CSS is that we can set any name which is not a specific name but depends on us and easy to animate things, also we can animate lots of things together.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can use a keyframe animation we set up earlier as a property in a ruleset for an element by using the specific name that we set in the keyframe in the element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keyframe animations have other keywords that aren't available in `transitions`, these are keywords: <b>@keyframes</b> and <b>0%/ from, 100%/ to</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can animate as many properties as we want at once.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are several of properties that are animatable, all the properties can change a value to one another.
          </li>
        </ol>
