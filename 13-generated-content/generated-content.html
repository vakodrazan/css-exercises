      <h1>Generated content, counters, and lists</h1>
      <p>
        In this exercise we are looking for generated content, counters, and lists
      </p>

    <main>
      <nav>
        <h2>Pseudo-element</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The special property for the pseudo-element is content. Without content property pseudo-element won't work.
          </li>
          <li>
            The function which we can use in that property's value depends on what you want it to be.
          </li>
          <li>
            These are the lists of the various pseudo-elements I could think:
            <ul>
              <li>::before</li>
              <li>::after</li>
              <li>::first-letter</li>
              <li>::first-line</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>We use pseudo-elements because we don't need to specify it in HTML, we don't have to edit the HTML. Also, it can be specified the element.</li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <article>
        <h2>Counters</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We use pseudo-element to count in css.</li>
          <li>
            There is some value that we can use when we want to reset a counter. We can use these values:
            <ul>
              <li>none</li>
              <li>inherit</li>
              <li>reset</li>
              <li>unset</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Counter are useful for the developer because they don't have to edit the html when they want to add another character lists.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <nav>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There is some properties only related to lists. Here are the lists of them which I could think of:
            <ul>
              <li>list-style</li>
              <li>line-style-image</li>
              <li>line-style-position</li>
              <li>line-style-type</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            There is some types of bullet styles in lists. It depends on what we've chosen. The most common are square, circle, disc, inside, and outside.
          </li>
          <li>We can use .</li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </main>
  </body>
