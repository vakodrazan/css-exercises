          There are several types of font formats, these are some of them:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Woff</b>(Web Open Font format)</li>
            <li><b>Woff2</b>(Web Open Font format2)</li>
            <li><b>TTF</b> (True Type)</li>
            <li><b>Otf</b>(Open Type)</li>
            <li><b>Eot</b>(Embedered Open Type)</li>
            <li><b>Svg</b>(Scalable Vector Graphics)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          What I make of it is <b>woff</b> and <b>woff2</b> are good candidate to use in all browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          Difference between a <b>@font-face</b>, we have to use <q>src: url() or local()</q> and <b>@keyframes</b>, it needs an animation name and have special character like <b>from / 0%</b> and <b>to / 100%</b> / <b>@media</b> queries / <b>@supports</b> blocks
        </li>
        <li>
          Some fonts come with licencing restriction means they are free for everyone to use but it need to download.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we want to support all the chosen fonts in here, we need to to provide eight font-face.
        </li>
        <li>
          At roughly 20kb per font file, our users would have to download 160KB in the example above.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we chose to offer WOOF2 as well as WOOF, we need to use the the <b>scr: ;</b> it has two url and two <b>format('the name')</b>. In each file we need to use the both font, according to the question 5 we only need eight font-face.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most of our users would probably have the exact font we want to serve already installed on their devices. We can use the <b>local(</b><q>the font's name</q><b>)</b> to make sure that the user's browser doesn't download the fonts they might already have.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes we have to assign fallback fonts for our custom webfonts we add via @font-face.
        </li>
        <li>
          The browser can use one of several strategies for loading the fonts, e.g. showing nothing until the font is downloaded, or using a fallback font first. We can use:
          <ul>
            <li>font-family</li>
            <li>font-size</li>
            <li>font-weight</li>
            <li>font-style</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </main>
  </body>
