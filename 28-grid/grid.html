            If we don't set any columns in in grid it will just try to fit in one column but if not, it'll create another column.
          </li>
          <li>
            The difference between flexbox and grid:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Flexbox</strong> only affects one of rows or columns.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Grid</strong> affects both rows and columns at the same time.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            When I want to specific what dimension I want to change I would use flexbox rather than grid because it is more specific.
          </li>
          <li>
            I would use grid rather than flexbox because I want to change everything at the same time that means I want to change rows and columns at the same time without specified them.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can have another way to write this <b>grid-template-columns: 10rem 10rem 10rem 10rem;</b>. This can be written as <b>grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 10rem);</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can specify a minimum height within its row increase in height if its content is too tall by using <strong>minmax()</strong> value.
          </li>
