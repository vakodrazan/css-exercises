              Transition property includes: <ul>
                <li>
                  layouts property such as: width, height, padding, margins, borders
                </li>
                <li>
                  Positional properties like :left, right, topand bottom
                </li>
                <li>
                  Transformations
                </li>
                <li>
                  Font sizes
                </li>
                <li>
                  Colors
                </li>
                <li>
                  Background colors
                </li>
                <li>
                  Opacities
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The difference between timing, delay and duration are:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Timing is for how long does it take transition when it's on the way.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Delay is for how long does it have to stay before it starts its journey.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Duration is how long does it have to continues.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              We can animated most of the CSS properties but there are some properties that we can't animate everyting properties named with text such as:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Text-align
                </li>
                <li>
                  Text-decoration
                </li>
                <li>
                  Text-enden
                </li>
                <li>
                  And also position.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              We can select more than one properties to transiton at a time by using pseudo-class hover and put all of the propertues that you want to enimate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transition is useful introducing thing or telling somithing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transitions can create a problem when you create something but you have to for it like 1s or so because of transition.
            </li>
            <li>
              Auto keyword doesn't work reliably with transitions because it doesn't discribe anyhing so the transition doesn't have anyhing to animate.
            </li>
            <li>
              We can stagger transitions by using the  <b>transition-delay</b> property for each child elements.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>
