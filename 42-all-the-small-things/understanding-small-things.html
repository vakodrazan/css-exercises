            <strong>Cursor</strong> is used to define the character of the element when it hovers on the elements. there are different of type of cursor value we can have. For example: <i>pointer</i>, <i>help</i>, <i>zoom-in</i>, <i>crosshair</i>, <i>text</i>. There are a lot but it depends on the situation of what kind of element it is like link or text.
