          <li>There are lots of function that we can use in a transform value. These are the list of them:
            <ul>
              <li>matrix()</li>
              <li>perspective()</li>
              <li>rotate()</li>
              <li>scale()</li>
              <li>skew()</li>
              <li>translate()</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            We have to use separate functions, in order, and as values, e.g. transform: scale(0.5) rotate(45deg); instead of using separate properties like this transform-scale: 0.5;, or transform-rotate: 45deg; because there is an order and relate on each other. There is no properties like transform-scale.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we want to move the central pin or axis of the transform away from its default position we can use the <b>transform-origin</b> property.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's preferable to use <b>transform: translate();</b> rather than <b>position</b> and its associated properties because it is quick and easy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When an element is translated or transformd it doesn't affect the flow of the document.
              </li>
              <li>
                The layout <b>positioning</b> is similar to a transform.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The problem you can run in to when overriding a transform in a more specific selector is the browser always create a style for the element that we create.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we want to go 3D, we need to use <b>perspective</b> property to set the view of the scene.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can control what the transform uses in its calculations in terms of the box model. We can use <strong>transform-box</strong> property to adjust this.
          </li>
