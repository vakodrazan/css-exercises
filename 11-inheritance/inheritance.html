      <h2>
        What is CSS inheritance?
      </h2>
      <p>
        When we heard of CSS inheritance the first things come to our mind is that children elements are inheritated their parents elements.

        <h2>
          The properties that have inherit value.
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are some properties that have inherit value by default. These are some of them: font-weight, font-style, line-height and text-align.

      <h2>
        Difference between the <b>currentcolor</b> and <b>inherit</b>
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><q>currentcolor</q></strong> sets the spicification of the color but it is for the independant elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><q>inherit</q></strong> sets the specification of color. It is child elements which inheritated its parents.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h2>
          The use of revert, initial and unset value
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong><q>revert</q></strong> is used to put back the things that you have been changed into its origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><q>initial</q></strong> seems as if there the user don't want to use any style but it sets from the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><q>unset</q></strong> is used to unstaged style and you dont want to apply them.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Any dangers or unitended side-effects
        </h2>
        <p>
          Be careful when using inherit value because it is sometimes changed things thatt you don't mean to.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the same as the other value like revert, initial and unset you need to emphacise the elements you want because it can affect all your work.
        </p>

        <h2>
          The possibilities with using an ancestor or universal selector.
        </h2>
        <p>
          It can be helpful to use ancestor or universal selector , combined with inherit value because it makes the elements more important.
